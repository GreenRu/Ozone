# The Ozone house style

**Ozone** is a family of small, cloud-themed, open-source desktop programs.
Stratus is the first of them; this page is the shared document the rest are built
against — what they have in common, what they may not do, and why.

Each program lives in its own repository. This one holds only what they share.

| Program | Is | Cloud word |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Stratus** | A web browser | A flat, layered sheet — the one you look *through* |
| **Nimbus** | A text editor | The rain cloud — the one that actually produces something |
| **Cumulus** | A file explorer | The heaped, many-lobed one — lots of small things, piled |
| **Sky Box** | The manager that installs and updates the others | The box they all come in |

Each is small on its own and has room to grow through plugins. None of them
depends on another; Sky Box knows how to fetch them, and that is the whole
relationship.

## How the repositories fit together

Each program is its own repository, and none of them depends on another. They sit
side by side inside this one, which is ignored by git here and cloned separately:

```
Ozone/                  GreenRu/Ozone - docs and the skill, nothing else
├── docs/HOUSE-STYLE.md  this file
├── skills/ozone/        the same thing, written for an agent to read
├── stratus/            GreenRu/Stratus
├── nimbus/             GreenRu/Nimbus
├── cumulus/            GreenRu/Cumulus
└── sky-box/            GreenRu/SkyBox
```

Sky Box knows how to fetch and update the others. That is the entire
relationship between them; nothing else may reach across.

## Naming things

The theme is weather, and it earns its place or it does not go in.

**Rename a thing when the metaphor is genuinely better, not to be cute.** In
Stratus a tab is a **cloud** (they stack, they drift, they merge and split), the
page area is the **sky**, a closing cloud **rains** and leaves a **puddle**, and
a kept page is a **droplet** — a cloud leaves droplets behind. Those all say
something. A "cirrus preferences pane" would not, and there isn't one.

Two rules keep it from becoming a private language:

- **The interface gets the new word; the data keeps the old one.** Droplets are
  stored under the key `bookmarks`, because that is what is already on disk and
  what every other program calls them — which is the language an importer has to
  speak. Rename the layer people read, not the layer machines read.
- **Keep the plain word reachable.** `stratus://bookmarks` still lands on the
  droplets page. Someone who does not know your metaphor should not hit a wall.

Each program answers to `<name>://` for its own internal pages —
`stratus://settings`, `nimbus://settings`, and so on.

## The look

One continuous sky fills the window; the content floats on it as a rounded card.
Controls live in a left column, not in a band across the top. Nothing is square,
nothing is grey, and nothing is loud.

Colours are CSS variables, never literals, so a theme can replace all of them.
The full set (40 in Stratus, and it will differ per program — that is fine):

```css
:root {
  --sky-top: #74b1e5;      --sky-bottom: #b6dbf6;   /* the window itself */
  --cloud: #ffffff;        --cloud-idle: #dcecfb;   /* the floating things */
  --cloud-hover: #eef6fe;
  --text: #22364c;         --text-dim: #5f7a96;     --text-on-sky: #24425f;
  --field: #ffffff;        --field-line: rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.10);
  --panel: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.74);               /* frosted, over the sky */
  --hover: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
  --accent: #2472cf;       --droplet: #2b9fd6;      --danger: #d94a4a;
  --stage: #eaf3fc;                                 /* where content sits */
  --shadow-card: 0 10px 30px rgba(16, 44, 76, 0.18);
  --page-radius: 16px;     --gutter: 10px;
  --ui-font: "Segoe UI Variable Display", "Segoe UI", system-ui, sans-serif;
  --brand-font: "Comfortaa", var(--ui-font);
}
```

**Every program ships two themes, named for a time of day that suits it** - the
same variable names underneath, different values, so a theme written for one is
comprehensible in another. The darker one is the same variables at different
values, never a filter, and the lighter one is the default.

| Program | Themes |
| --- | --- |
| Stratus | **day** / **night** - a browser is a window you look through |
| Nimbus | **sunset** / **dusk** - warm light to write by, then the lamp on |
| Cumulus | to be chosen when it is built |
| Sky Box | to be chosen when it is built |

The program's icon is drawn from its own palette, so the family reads as a family
without any two looking alike. Every program reads `nativeTheme` for the window
controls, which are drawn by the system and need a real colour rather than a
variable.

Shapes:

| Thing | Radius |
| --- | --- |
| Anything pill-shaped — buttons, chips, fields | `999px` |
| Cards, menus, sheets | `22px` |
| The content card | `var(--page-radius)`, 16px |

**Clouds are drawn, not drawn *on*.** `stratus/src/shared/clouds.js` builds a cloud as a
rounded body with lobes rising off its top edge, each lobe carrying
`background: inherit` so the whole thing reads as one silhouette under one
shadow. Shapes come from a hash of a stable seed rather than `Math.random`, so
every cloud differs from its neighbours and keeps its own shape for life instead
of re-rolling on each render:

```js
CloudShape.buildLobes(element, `menu-${id}`, {
  width: element.offsetWidth, base: 30, spacing: 84,
  minLobes: 2, maxLobes: 4, overhang: 0, widthRatio: [1.5, 2.6]
});
```

Copy the file. It has no dependencies and knows nothing about browsers.

Fills that overlap must be **opaque**. Lobes cross each other, and any alpha
compounds where they do and exposes the seams.

## Motion

Everything that appears, grows or is pressed overshoots slightly and settles.
Nothing eases linearly, and nothing is instant.

```css
--ease:       cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1);      /* moving between places */
--spring:     cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1);   /* the jelly */
--spring-big: cubic-bezier(0.22, 1.7, 0.36, 1);    /* arrivals */
--t-fast: 160ms;  --t-mid: 260ms;  --t-slow: 380ms;
```

Motion should say what happened. A droplet arrives by falling and squashing, not
by spinning. A closing cloud drifts down, rains, and leaves a puddle. If an
animation would look the same for two different events, it is decoration and can
go.

One trap, paid for once already: **a filled animation outranks inline styles.**
`animation: x 1s both` keeps its last keyframe applying forever and silently
beats every later attempt to set `transform` or `opacity` from script. Set
`animation: none` on the state that takes over.

## The shape of the code

Electron, one renderer per window, and three kinds of code that never blur:

```
src/
  main/         Node. Owns all state, the disk, and every privileged call.
  preload/      The only bridge. Enumerates channels explicitly.
  renderer/     The interface. Draws state; owns none of it.
  pages/        The program's own pages, loaded from file://
  shared/       Loaded by both the interface and the pages (plain scripts,
                attaching to window — they cross a module boundary)
plugins/        Bundled plugins, all switched off until asked for
docs/           ARCHITECTURE, PRIVACY, PLUGINS, TESTING, this file
```

Windows are `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `sandbox: true`,
without exception. A preload exposes a hand-written object, never `ipcRenderer`:

```js
contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('cloud', {
  droplets: {
    toggle: () => ipcRenderer.send('droplet:toggle'),
    menu:   (id, x, y) => ipcRenderer.send('droplet:menu', id, x, y)
  }
});
```

State flows one way. The interface gets a full snapshot because it draws all of
it; a content page gets **a knock at the door with nothing in it** and asks for
exactly what it is allowed to have. Nothing about one document leaks into
another that never asked.

Preferences live in one JSON file in the user-data directory, read through a
defaults-merged `Store`. **On-disk keys are permanent.** Renaming one costs a
migration, and a migration that goes wrong costs somebody their data.

## Enumerate, then ask

**Before building a feature, work out the whole space of what could be built,
show it, and ask which parts to do.** This applies to every program in the
family, and to every request, however small the wording sounds.

"Add the basic features" is not a specification. Whoever asks has a picture of
what "basic" covers, and it is never the same picture as the one whoever builds
it has. Guessing produces two bad outcomes and no good one: half the list gets
built and the missing half has to be asked for again, or all of it gets built and
most of it was not wanted.

So:

1. **List everything the feature area could reasonably contain** - including the
   parts nobody mentioned, and the structural work the rest would sit on.
   Grouped, so the list can be read rather than waded through.
2. **Say what each thing costs** where it is not obvious - especially where one
   item is a whole afternoon and its neighbour is ten minutes, or where one has
   to be built before another can be.
3. **Ask which to build.** Offer the list; do not pick a subset quietly and do
   not build all of it on the assumption that more is better.
4. **Then build exactly what came back**, in full.

The list itself is worth as much as the code. It is the only point at which the
shape of a program is cheap to change, and writing it down is what turns "add
some editor features" into a decision somebody actually made.

The exception is a fix: a defect has one correct behaviour, and asking which
parts of "working properly" to implement is noise. Fix it, and say what you
found.

## Rules that do not bend

- **Tidy is not the same as correct.** Denying a browser engine's request
  because your own arrangement is neater can suppress work it was going to do on
  your behalf - in Stratus, denying a popup silently cancelled every download
  that started on the same click. When you turn something down, check what else
  went with it.
- **Refuse rather than degrade.** Secrets are encrypted with Electron's
  `safeStorage`, which delegates to the OS keystore. If the platform cannot
  encrypt, saving is *refused* — never written in the clear. A password store
  that quietly isn't one is worse than none.
- **Keep only what a list has to show.** A username, a card's last four digits.
  Everything else is ciphertext at rest.
- **The page never says who it is.** When something fills a form, the origin
  comes from the sending view's own URL, read in the main process. A page that
  can name an origin can ask for someone else's secrets.
- **Guess nothing.** With two saved entries matching, fill neither: there is no
  way to know which is meant, and asking is better than guessing wrong.
- **A setting that destroys data says so, and means it.** Stratus's "keep the
  code on the back of the card" switch destroys every stored code when turned
  off *and writes down when*, so a code that outlives the wipe in a backup is
  still never offered. Where a rule must survive a restored file, enforce it with
  a timestamp, not only a deletion.
- **No dependency unless there is genuinely no choice.** Firefox's compressed
  bookmark backups are decoded in about forty lines rather than by pulling in a
  package. Read the format; it is usually smaller than the wrapper.
- **Guard anything that can be destroyed.** `isDestroyed()` before touching a
  view, every time. Teardown will find the one place you skipped.

## Native views, and the law about them

This is the most expensive thing to get wrong, and it generalises to any of these
programs that embeds content — a browser, an editor with a preview pane, an
explorer with a file preview.

**A native view is a child of the window, not part of your document. Your
interface cannot draw over it.** Anything the renderer draws inside the area a
view covers is simply not on screen — every measurement correct, nothing
visible. And `capturePage` on the renderer will *not* show you: it captures the
renderer alone, so the missing part looks perfectly present. Only a real screen
capture tells you.

It has been got wrong three times in Stratus: the preview card, the cloud menu,
and then the droplet menu, which hangs down off a bar that is itself fine.

So: **anything that overlays content is its own view.** One menu view serves
every menu. It is handed a list of labels and hands back the name of whichever
was chosen; what that name *means* is decided in the main process, which is where
the state is. Adding a new kind of menu is a `thingMenu()` that returns a
description and a `runThingMenu()` that acts on a name — and nothing else.

The layout goes the other way round: the renderer measures its placeholder
element and reports the rectangle; the main process converts it to view bounds. A
`ResizeObserver` on the placeholder means anything that changes the layout —
showing a bar, collapsing a sidebar — re-reports for free.

## Plugins

Every program in the family takes plugins, and they all use the same shape:
**a folder with a `plugin.json` beside whatever files it names.**

Manifests are **declarative**. A plugin says what it wants applied and where; the
program applies it. There is **no plugin code in the main process**, and there is
not going to be — that is the entire security model, not a detail of it. Scripts
a plugin injects run in an isolated world.

```json
{
  "id": "my-plugin",
  "name": "My Plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "One line about what it does.",

  "commands": [{ "id": "toggle", "label": "Toggle it", "accelerator": "CommandOrControl+Alt+M" }],
  "styles":   [{ "matches": ["*://*.example.com/*"], "css": "skin.css" }],
  "scripts":  [{ "matches": ["<all_urls>"], "js": "content.js" }],
  "pages":    { "stratus://my-plugin": "page.html" },
  "themes":   [{ "id": "custom", "name": "Custom", "fields": [], "variables": {} }],
  "toolbar":  [{ "id": "open", "label": "Open it", "after": "back" }]
}
```

Two folders are read: the one in the repository, and the one in the profile.
A plugin in the profile replaces a bundled one with the same id.

**Everything is off until switched on.** The store keeps the list of what is
*on*, so dropping a folder in makes a plugin available, not active. Ship a couple
of real ones as worked examples — a theme, something that injects, something with
a page of its own — and they double as the test suite for the host.

## Testing

There is no framework. A suite is a script the program's own runtime executes,
which is the only way to test something whose behaviour lives in a window
manager, a compositor and a keystore.

```bash
npx electron suite.js
```

The rules, each of which was learned by losing an afternoon:

- **A throwaway profile per suite.** `fs.mkdtempSync`, and `app.setName` before
  anything reads a path.
- **Kill strays first.** `taskkill //F //IM electron.exe`. The single-instance
  lock hands your launch to an older process, and an occluded window pauses its
  CSS animations and throttles its timers — three assertions once failed
  reproducibly with nothing wrong in the code.
- **Print each assertion as it runs**, and set a watchdog. A suite that only
  prints at the end goes silent exactly when it hangs.
- **Assert the value, not the declaration.** Checking that an animation lasts
  three seconds proves nothing about what it does. Sample the opacity halfway
  through.
- **Name assertions as sentences.** `check('a code that predates the last
  switch-off is not offered', ...)`. The output should read as a description of
  the program.
- **Synthetic events do not exercise the real input path.** A dispatched
  `MouseEvent` skips the pointer path entirely, so a suite can pass green while
  real clicks do nothing. Pointer behaviour needs a real OS click - and a
  scripted `.click()` carries no user gesture, which is enough on its own to
  change what a browser engine lets the page do next.
- **A window with `show: false` never gives its document focus**, so anything
  depending on `focusin` or `activeElement` quietly never happens.
- **Finish with a real boot.** Every suite that constructs your app object by
  hand skips your entry point entirely. `npx electron .` catches the missing
  `let` that 28 green assertions did not.

When something is wrong, **measure it — do not reason about it**. Pixel
sampling, geometry probes, event logs. Most of the expensive bugs here looked
like one thing and were another: "the last fields were not recognised" was
really an exception thrown on the third of them, which abandoned the rest.

## Prose, comments and commits

The programs are small and the writing is part of them.

- **Comments explain why, never what.** If a line needs saying what it does,
  rename something instead. Prefer a short paragraph above a tricky block to a
  string of end-of-line notes.
- **Plain sentences.** No shouting, no "NOTE:", no decoration. Write as though
  explaining to somebody who will maintain it next year.
- **Record the trap where it was set.** When something took an afternoon to
  find, the comment that stops the next person losing the same afternoon is worth
  more than the fix.
- **User-facing text is a sentence, not a label.** "No droplets yet — Ctrl+D
  keeps a page here", not "Empty". Say what will happen, not what is missing.
- **Commit messages say what changed and why it is that way**, in prose, in the
  present tense. The subject line is a statement, not a category prefix.

## Open source

GPL-3.0-or-later, with the notice at the head of each entry point. Every program
in the family ships:

- a `README.md` that shows what it does before it explains how to build it;
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — the parts, the stacking order, and the traps;
- `docs/PRIVACY.md` — where the profile is, what is in each file, what is
  encrypted, and what leaves the machine (for most of these: nothing);
- `docs/PLUGINS.md` — the tour, with the field reference beside the plugins;
- `docs/TESTING.md` — how to run the suites and what has already gone wrong;
- this file, so the next one in the family starts where the last one finished.

Nothing phones home. If a program ever needs the network for its own sake rather
than the user's, that is a decision documented in `PRIVACY.md` with a switch
beside it.
